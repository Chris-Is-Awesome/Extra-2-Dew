- Add UI stuff
- Make custom debug commands work

- Create `Core` to hold integral functions for the entire mod
-  Create `SaveManager` to handle saving data to PlayerPrefs, Entity, save files (todo), and custom files (todo)
- Create `DebugManager` to output debug info to `output.txt` file. Output a test "GAME STARTED" in `LudositySplash.Awake()`
- Create project. Realized I took a wrong turn in life that has led me to rewrite 18k+ lines of code for a mod that a handful of people would use :)
